  Use "hcp" commands to authenticate users and machines to HCP with explicit
  credentials or an HCP token and interactive browser login.

# hcp

The `hcp` command groups subcommands for authentication of users or machines to HCP using
either provided arguments or retrieved HCP token through browser login.

By default, the `hcp` command uses interactive authentication that requires
users to log into the HashiCorp Cloud Platform with a browser.

Non-interactive login requires a service principal credential that was
previously generated through the HCP portal. The service principal must have
access to the requested organization, project, and HCP Vault cluster.

If authentication succeeds, the Vault CLI saves the returned HCP token and HCP
Vault address in the local cache.

## Examples

Connect to HCP interactively:

```shell-session
$ vault hcp connect
The default web browser has been opened at <auth_url>. Please continue the login in the web browser.
Success!
```

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

### Command options

- `-client-id` `(string: "")` - Client ID belonging to the service principal credential generated in the HCP Portal.
If provided along with a Secret ID, a non-interactive authentication method will take place.

- `-secret-id` `(string: "")` - Secret ID belonging to the service principal credential generated in the HCP Portal.
If provided along with a Client ID, a non-interactive authentication method will take place.

- `-organization-id` `(string: "")` - Optional ID of the desired HCP
  organization. If `organization-id` is empty and the user is associated with
  multiple HCP organizations, the CLI prompts the user to select from a list
  of available organizations.

- `-project-id` `(string: "")` - Project ID of the HCP Project. This is optional and in case it's not provided,
and the user is associated with more than one HCP Project, they will be offered a list of projects to choose from in the CLI.

- `-cluster-id` `(string: "")` - Cluster ID of the HCP Vault Cluster. This is optional and in case it's not provided,
and the user is associated with more than one HCP Vault Cluster, they will be offered a list of clusters to choose from in the CLI.
